# Query-a-digital-music-store-database-project
In this project, I queried the Chinook Database using SQL. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. I assisted the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.
the respiratory contains three files,a .db file named "chinook.db" which holds the database, a .txt file name "queries.txt" which contains the code for the SQL queries, and .pdf file named "presentation.pdf" which is a pdf of a slideshow used to visualize and explain the insights generated from the queries.
